    /* The validation for commit-only transactions follows the usual protocol:
    (1) helpCommitAll, (2) snapshotValidation, and (3) validateAndEnqueue.  The
    difference is that now others may also be helping with the validation. So:

    - initially, check if validation already completed.  This is also useful to
    avoid starting the validation when there is only one (already validated)
    entry in the commit requests queue, and we're just waiting until more requests
    arrive.  Actually, I think that doing this would skip enqueuing if needed,
    so we should be doing the normal validation and just skipping when we really
    see them done.  In short, if already valid just move along to enqueueing.

    - snapshot validation is a helped phase (split into buckets).  if it fails
    the request is marked as failed.  however, care must be taken to check that
    if a read vbox already contains a more recent entry, such entry may belong
    to this transaction already! (someone else helped quite a lot!).  In that
    case, the whole commit for this transaction is done! :-)  As usual, a more
    recent write by another to a VBox that was read, will cause validation to
    fail.

    - validateCommitAndEnqueue only needs to be attempted once.  Given that
    snapshotValidation passed, then if enqueue fails it's because someone else
    did it already.  Moving along...

//                invalid. If it doesn't exists, we may continue validation.
//                However, we can speed up the conclusion bu also checking whether
//                there is a commit for commitNumber.  If so, then this transaction
//                is immediately valid or invalid depending on whether such
//                commitNumber's commitId is ours.  Question: do we need to reload
//                everything from the most recent down to the lastSeenCommittedTxNumber?
//                Probably yes to ensure the invariant of the reload. Then we only
//                need to check the most recent loaded version :-).
//
//                Another note: a simple reload here is not enough, because reloads
//                only load up to the mostRecentCommit seen by this node.  We need
//                to know whether THIS request may have been already committed by
//                another node!
//
//                NOTE: We never enter this branch of the if in a
//                LocalCommitOnlyTransaction, but it doesn't hurt to have this
//                code in the common CommitOnlyTransaction.
//
//                In summary: If I'm not mistaken, after asking for a reload of
//                version mostRecentCommitted (whatever that may be), I'll be able
//                to run (exactly?) the same code as the one that runs when the
//                box is loaded...  */
//                // it is enough to reload the most recent version in order to decide about validation
//                vbox.reload(lastSeenCommittedTxNumber);
//            } /*else {*/

            if (vbox.body.version == 0) {

            }

            // check whether the read was valid

                /* caution: it could be our own commit that we're seeing!
                But, in that case, validation must have finished! If validation
                hasn't finished, this implies that no more recent version
                could have been loaded and the version we're seeing is >
                myReadVersion but lower than my prospective commit version,
                which means I'm invalid.

                (true for local tx only?!)

                Can validation NOT have finished in this node, and what we
                see written is a box that another node already wrote.  No,
                because our reload only loads versions that may be necessary
                in this node.  By 'be necessary' I mean reload loads at
                highest, from the mostRecentlyCommitted version.  So, for a
                box version to be higher than my read version, either a local
                commit or a remote commit higher than my read version (but
                lower than mostRecentCommitted) must have already been
                processed in this node, which ultimately implies that THIS
                commit request needs to have its validation status already
                set (after all, it was ahead in the queue!)

                So, if this commit request's validation state is unset after
                we already have seen a body with a version > myReadVersion,
                this commit request must be invalid.
