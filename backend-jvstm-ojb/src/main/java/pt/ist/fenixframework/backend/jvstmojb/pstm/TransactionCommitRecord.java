/*
 * This class is a generalization of what already existed for keeping
 * a record of AlienTransactions (that is, transactions committed on
 * another server) so that we keep a record of objects changed that
 * should not be garbage-collected.
 *
 * The same should be done for locally committed transactions,
 * because, otherwise, objects changed on a transaction Tn that are
 * garbage collected and then read by a later transaction may result
 * in having older transactions seeing values from the future.
 *
 * To see why this may happen, consider the case of three
 * transactions, T1, T2, and T3, from oldest to newer, where T2
 * changes some object O before T1 accesses it.  If O is GCed and T3
 * needs to access it, T3 will allocate the object and eventually read
 * it, putting the values read in version 0 (that's what VBox.makeNew
 * does).  If after this T1 accesses O, it will see the value written
 * by T2, which is not correct.
 *
 * By having T2 add a CommitRecord to this class, we will maintain a
 * strong reference to O, meaning that it will not be garbage
 * collected.
