    /*
     * This SpecialBody class is a hack that will eventually disappear.
     * It is a simple extension of a MultiVersionBoxBody so that it holds a 
     * strong reference to the box which is owning it.  Instances of this class
     * are created only during the processing of an AlientTransaction
     * (see TransactionChangeLogs) when a new version is added to a RelationList.
     * Because RelationLists use a SoftReference to keep the VBox (so that the 
     * bi-directional relations do not prevent the GC from working), it could happen
     * that the VBox of a RelationList got GCed after the processing of an AlientTransaction 
     * but before older running transactions finished.  If meanwhile a more recent transaction
     * accessed the RelationList, it would load its value and associate it with version 0, which 
     * is wrong.  So, until the AlientTransaction gets cleaned up (see the 
     * TransactionChangeLogs.cleanOldAlienTxs method), we must prevent that the VBox be GCed.
     * This class ensures it, because the AlientTransaction keeps strong a reference to an instance of 
     * this class which has also a strong reference to the VBox.
     * Finally, when the cleanOldAlienTxs method runs and calls the freeResources on the AlienTransaction,
     * it calls the clearPrevious method of each body, which, in this case, also removes the reference to
     * the VBox.
     *
     * It's a *little* bit confusing, I know, but...
